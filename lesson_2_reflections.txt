Q1:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1:
Git adds a .git folder to the directory you created the repository in. If you
want to use version control, you have to initialize the repository. Git won't
know about the repository otherwise.

Q2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A2:
It's a holding area. It's temporary storage. It's neither the working directory
nor the repository.
It seems like it offers the possibility to only commit certain files from a
working directory into the repository. So you don't have to track everything.
Or if you have multiple branches, you can add some files to one branch, then
swap into another branch and add other files to that one. All from within a
single working directory.
