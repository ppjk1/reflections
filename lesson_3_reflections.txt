Q1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1:
If I split my work time between the office and home and actually perform my work on
two separate computers, I can use a remote repository to keep my files more easily in
sync.

If I'm working with a team, a remote repository is pretty much a necessity.

If I want some data loss protection, then a remote acts like another backup.

Q2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2:
The remote repo could be updated by someone else, and their code additions
could cause trouble or distract you from work you're currently doing.
