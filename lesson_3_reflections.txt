Q1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1:
If I split my work time between the office and home and actually perform my work on
two separate computers, I can use a remote repository to keep my files more easily in
sync.

If I'm working with a team, a remote repository is pretty much a necessity.

If I want some data loss protection, then a remote acts like another backup.
